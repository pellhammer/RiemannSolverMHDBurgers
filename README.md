# Background viscosity dependent Riemann solver for the MHD-Burgers model


## DESCRIPTION:
The enclosed MATLAB function computes the values of the unique solution to the Riemann problem for two inviscid Burgers equations at the time level
t=1 such that every discontonuity has a viscous profile w.r.t. the viscosity matrix [1,kappa;kappa,1] for -1 &lt; kappa &lt; 1.
This code refers to the paper "Dependence on the background viscosity of solutions to a prototypical non-strictly hyperbolic system of conservation laws"
written by Heinrich Freist√ºhler and the author of this code.

All codes are written in MATLAB R2020a.
